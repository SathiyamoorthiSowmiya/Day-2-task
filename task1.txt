Difference between document and window object:

Window Object:

* The Window object is a global object in client-side. 
* representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.
* The window object, supported by all browsers.
* The browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.
* The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects.
* providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows.

   EX: alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().

   Properties:

   1. window.innerHeight

   2.window.innerWidth 

   Methods:

  1. window.open() - open a new window

  2. window.close() - close the current window

  3. window.moveTo() - move the current window

  4. window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

  Document Object:

  * The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. 
  * The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.
  * The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform-neutral interface. 
  * That enables dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.
  * The DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access to change its structure, style, or content.

  EX: getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement().

  Properties:

  1.element.innerHTML = new html content
  
  2.element.attribute = new value.

  Methods:

1.document.createElement-Create an HTML element

2.document.removeChild-Remove an HTML element
